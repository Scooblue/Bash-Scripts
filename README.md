## Purpose of this repo

I am having fun with writing scripts and will be posting more of them as I mess around. May have some proof of concept malware, will probably do a lot of different network scripts with bash, probably C as well.

You may see a few tools I will create myself here, they may be posted in a seperate folder, who knows. This is mainly just fun and jokes.
